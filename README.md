## Overview

This project uses Power BI to analyze customer demographics, assess customer risks, and predict customer churn. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help businesses understand their customer base, identify potential risks, and implement strategies to reduce churn.

## Objectives

- Customer Demographics Analysis: Explore and visualize the demographic characteristics of the customer base.
- Customer Risk Assessment: Identify customers who may pose a higher risk of churn based on specific criteria.
- Churn Prediction: Analyze patterns and factors contributing to customer churn and visualize potential churners.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Import and Preparation

- Data Source
- Data Cleaning
- Data Transformation

### 2. Customer Demographics Analysis

- Age Distribution: Visualize the age distribution of customers to identify key age groups.
- Geographic Distribution: Map customer locations to understand the geographic spread of the customer base.
- Income Levels: Analyze customer income levels and segment customers based on purchasing power.
- Customer Segmentation: Group customers into segments based on demographics like age, income, and location.

### 3. Customer Risk Assessment

- Risk Indicators: Identify indicators that suggest higher customer risks, such as low engagement, high service usage without corresponding spending, or negative customer feedback.
- Risk Scoring: Create a risk scoring model to rank customers based on their likelihood of churn.
- Visualization: Use dashboards to display risk scores and highlight high-risk customer segments.

### 4. Churn Prediction and Analysis

- Churn Factors: Analyze key factors contributing to customer churn, such as poor customer service, high product prices, or competitive offers.
- Predictive Modeling: Implement and visualize predictive models that estimate the likelihood of churn for each customer.
- Churn Heatmap: Use a heatmap to visualize areas with high churn risk and identify trends.

## Power BI Features Used

- Dashboards: Interactive dashboards to visualize customer demographics, risks, and churn predictions.
- Data Modeling: Use of relationships between tables to create a comprehensive data model.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated columns, measures, and aggregations.
- Custom Visuals: Implementation of custom visuals to enhance data representation.

## How to Use

1. Setup Power BI: Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed.
2. Load Data: Import the provided datasets into Power BI.
3. Run the Reports: Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) and explore the reports and dashboards.
4. Interact with Visuals: Use filters, slicers, and other interactive elements to dive deeper into the data and customize the view based on your needs.
